## Introduction
This report analyzes the threatened vertebrates dataset, which contains information about various species at risk of extinction across different regions. The analysis aims to explore trends in the number of threatened species over time, focusing on a selection of regions. The following visualizations will be used to gain insights into the data:

1.Time Series Visualization: A line chart to show the trend of threatened vertebrates over time across selected regions. This visualization helps to observe the change in the number of threatened species in each region.

2.Distribution by Region: A bar chart representing the distribution of threatened species across randomly selected regions. This will provide insights into which regions have the highest concentration of threatened species.

3.Boxplot: A boxplot to visualize the distribution of the number of threatened species by region. It shows the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers in the data for each region.

4.Regression Analysis: A scatterplot with a regression line to explore the relationship between the year and the number of threatened species. This visualization helps in understanding the overall trend and whether there is an increasing or decreasing pattern.

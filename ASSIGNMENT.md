# DSCI 554 Exploratory and Statistical Data Analysis Assignment


## Description

The assignment involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on UN Data, focusing on visual analytics. In this task, you will utilize generative AI to create R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. The primary objective of the notebooks is to present and effectively communicate the EDA findings to a peer data scientist. 

## Environment

The notebooks must be developed and tested using the latest available Python, R, and RStudio versions. Graders will use the same environment to execute the notebooks.

## Notebooks

You are required to submit at least:
- One R Markdown notebook
- One Jupyter notebook.

## Use of Graphing Libraries

You must create at least one visualization with these graphing libraries:

- ggplot2: in R notebook
- Altair: in Python notebook
- Matplotlib: in Python notebook
- Seaborn: in Python notebook
- Pandas: in Python notebook

## Data Analysis Considerations

Consider the following in your analysis, and for each, what visualization forms are best adapted to show the relevant information:

1. Ways to Understand the Data Context
2. Ways to Clean and Prepare the Data
3. Descriptive Statistics
4. Exploring Correlations and Relationships
5. Significance Testing for Hypothesis Testing
6. Handling Multivariate Analysis
7. Time Series and Trends
8. Addressing Data Imbalances
9. Regression Modeling

## Submission Guidelines

Before submitting your work, please ensure the following:

1. **Notebook Execution**  
   Ensure that all notebooks run without errors in the required environment before submission.  

2. **Notebook Outputs**  
   Before every commit, clear all outputs in the notebooks so they are committed without any executed cells.  

3. **Documentation and Clarity**  
   Ensure the notebooks are thoroughly documented in **Markdown**. Provide clear explanations for each step, comments on the code, and relevant references where necessary.

4. **Generative AI Usage Insights**
   In the `SUBMISSION.md` file (follow the template):
   - Document your use of Generative AI for data analysis, visualization, and notebook development.
   - Provide links to the Generative AI prompts you used
   - Include any key learnings or challenges encountered

6. **HTML Output of Jupyter and R Notebooks**
   - Export your Notebooks as HTML pages and upload the pages to Google Drive
   - Share the Google Drive pages with **all the instructors**
   - Provide a link to the HTML files in `SUBMISSION.md` (follow the template)

|               | **Sophisticated**                                            | **Competent**                                           | **Needs Improvement**                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Analysis, Visual Analytics, and Communication** | Analysis is comprehensive, addressing all key aspects: understanding the data context, cleaning/preparing the data, descriptive statistics, correlations, significance testing, multivariate analysis, time series, data imbalances, and regression modeling. Visualizations are well-designed and effectively communicate trends, relationships, and insights. They include clear titles, axis labels, legends, and annotations. Necessary contextual information (e.g., data sources, units, definitions) is provided. Markdown documentation is thorough, with clear explanations of each step, code comments, and relevant references. | Analysis is partially complete, addressing some but not all key aspects (e.g., missing significance testing or time series analysis). Visualizations lack some clarity, proper labeling, or completeness in conveying key insights. Markdown documentation is present but lacks detail or organization. Some contextual information may be missing or unclear. | Analysis is incomplete or missing key aspects (e.g., no cleaning, minimal descriptive statistics, no hypothesis testing). Visualizations are poorly designed, unclear, or missing. Critical labels, titles, or contextual details are absent. Markdown documentation is sparse, disorganized, or absent. |
| **Use of Generative AI** | Generative AI is effectively and thoughtfully used for EDA, visualizations, and notebook development. Links to AI interactions are provided, demonstrating appropriate use. AI use significantly enhances the analysis and visualization process. | Generative AI is used but not fully integrated into the analysis or visualization process. Links to AI interactions are incomplete or missing. AI use adds some value but is not well-documented or effectively applied. | Generative AI is not used, or its use is ineffective. Links to AI interactions are not provided, and there is no evident impact on the analysis or visualizations. |
| **Notebooks and Tools** | Including plots from all required libraries (e.g., ggplot2, Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas). Notebooks are submitted without executed cells and run without errors in the required environment. Code cells are thoroughly documented and formatted in markdown for readability. | Required notebooks are submitted but may be missing some plots from required libraries. Notebooks may include executed cells or run with minor errors in the required environment. Documentation in Markdown is present but incomplete or lacks clarity. | Required notebooks are missing or incomplete. Multiple plots from required libraries are missing. Notebooks include executed cells and/or fail to run in the required environment. Documentation in Markdown is sparse or absent. |
